# Bug Bounty

The Euler protocol smart contracts have gone through several audits, but may still contain implicit or hidden vulnerabilities.

We strongly encourage the community to undertake their own audits, and will reward individuals that responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities they find. Up to $1m is up for grabs. Start hunting today!

Bugs can be reported directly [here](mailto:security@euler.xyz) or through DeFi's leading bug bounty platform Immunefi, [here](https://immunefi.com/bounty/euler/).
