# Euler Bug Bounty Program

Security is our top priority and we value the input of ethical hackers in helping us maintain the highest smart contract security standards in the Ethereum ecosystem. 

The Euler protocol smart contracts having gone through several audits may contain implicit or hidden vulnerabilities. We encourage the community to audit our contracts and security as well as the responsible disclosure of any found vulnerabilities. 

To do this, we are in the process of setting up a bug bounty program which will be hosted on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/), DeFi's leading bug bounty platform and we will be announcing this once it is launched. 

Please check this page later for more information or look out for our announcement on all our social media and community pages.
