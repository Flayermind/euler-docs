# Insurance

Euler protocol has access to $10M in smart contract coverage provided by [Sherlock](https://mirror.xyz/0xE400820f3D60d77a3EC8018d44366ed0d334f93C/WWuglPwGDDkGgBlOt1Tz9JbPv6xhQx7lyFEeiXllcDI) as part of a collaborative [partnership](https://blog.euler.finance/euler-partners-with-sherlock-for-decentralized-exploit-protection-32e522baa265). This also includes an audit report and a $1M ImmuneFi bug bounty provided by Sherlock.

Sherlock's coverage is managed by the protocols/DAO instead of users, while its claims decisions are made by an unbiased 3rd party.

Read more about Sherlock's insurance program at their [website](https://www.sherlock.xyz/) or in their [documentation](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/faq) for further details.
