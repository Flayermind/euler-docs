# Governance Process

## Introduction

On-chain governance, allows unique features such as delegated voting and proposition powers, rapid protocol (and governance configuration) upgrades via a time lock executor. 
This ensures the protocol can quickly adapt to evolving market conditions, as well as upgrade core parts of the protocol over time.


## General Governance Process 
The [General Governance Process](https://forum.euler.finance/t/welcome-to-the-euler-governance-forum/7) is documented on the Governance Forum.

The general flow for the governance process is proposed as follows:
Governance forum Idea/Proposal Discussion → eIP (Euler Improvement Proposal) creation on Governance forum by forum moderator → eIP created on Tally (On-chain Proposal Creation) → On-chain Voting (and Execution if successful)


### Idea
A great place to start a discussion on a potential governance proposal is the idea section on the forum website. If you feel confident that your idea is relevant to the community and is well-formulated, head over to the Governance Forum to begin a discussion with the community around your idea (following the process described on the forum). 

Once a discussion / commenting begins around your idea, be proactive with the community and be open to suggestions. It typically takes a week for the request for comments to mature before it becomes an eIP.

### Governance Proposal
If the discussion is well-formulated and the community has a clear understanding of the proposal and supports your idea, it will be moved by a moderator to the governance category as an eIP: Euler Improvement Proposal. Once the proposal has an eIP, an on-chain proposal can be created on the Tally governance dashboard under the EulerDAO.

A Tally proposal vote does not always need to be posted by the original eIP author, it can be posted by someone else or by the core team in case the minimum threshold of EUL is not being met.

A good governance proposal example can be found here: [eIP: Promote WBTC to collateral tier 3](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-1-promote-wbtc-to-collateral-tier/27).
