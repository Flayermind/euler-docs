# Governance Process

## Introduction

On-Chain governance, allows unique features such as delegated voting and proposition powers, as well as protocol (and governance configuration) updates via a time lock executor. 
This ensures the protocol can adapt to evolving market conditions, as well as upgrade core parts of the protocol over time.

On the other hand, for off-chain governance, there is no code to review or implement as such. It is mainly a call for the Euler Foundation to carry out an action. Issue a grant, or pay a bill, for example. Thus mainly used to aid Euler in making difficult decisions in collaboration with the community. 

Euler uses the [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xd8E2114f6bCbaee83CDEB1bD6650a28BBcF144D5) governance interface for on-chain voting. [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x3b4b7e79c40df6860e7d612bdccc4969753e283dfd84673dc5fc4d201abcb317) on the other hand is an interface use for off-chain or 'gasless' voting. 



## General Governance Process 
The [General Governance Process](https://forum.euler.finance/t/welcome-to-the-euler-governance-forum/7) is documented on the Governance Forum.

The general flow for the on-chain governance process is proposed as follows:
Creation of a formal Idea/Proposal on Governance forum for discussion → eIP (Euler Improvement Proposal) creation on Governance forum by forum moderator → eIP created on Tally (on-chain proposal creation) → On-Chain Voting (and Execution on target Euler protocol smart contract if successful).

The general flow for the off-chain governance process is proposed as follows:
Creation of a formal Idea/Proposal on Governance forum for discussion → Proposal created on Snapshot (off-chain proposal creation) → Off-Chain Voting (and Execution of proposal action by Euler Foundation if successful).


### Idea
A great place to start a discussion on a potential governance proposal is the idea section on the forum website. If you feel confident that your idea is relevant to the community and is well-formulated, head over to the Governance Forum to begin a discussion with the community around your idea (following the process described on the forum). 

Once a discussion / commenting begins around your idea, be proactive with the community and be open to suggestions. It typically takes a week for the request for comments to mature before it becomes an eIP.

### Governance Proposal
If the discussion is well-formulated and the community has a clear understanding of the proposal and supports your idea, (for on-chain proposals) it will be moved by a moderator to the governance category as an eIP: Euler Improvement Proposal. Once the proposal has an eIP, an on-chain proposal can be created on the [Tally governance dashboard](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xd8E2114f6bCbaee83CDEB1bD6650a28BBcF144D5).

A Tally or Snapshot proposal does not always need to be created by the original eIP author / proposer, it can be posted by someone else or by the core team in case the minimum threshold of EUL is not being met.

A good governance proposal example can be found here: [eIP: Promote WBTC to collateral tier 3](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-1-promote-wbtc-to-collateral-tier/27).
