# Governance

## Introduction&#x20;

Euler will be managed in the long term by a decentralised community through on-chain governance on the Ethereum network. The community are holders of a protocol-native governance token called [EUL](../eul/)(pronounced 'oil'), which enables the community to effect change over the Euler Protocol code. Tokens can be used to propose upgrades to the protocol or vote on the proposals of others. EUL tokens represent voting powers over the protocol.

## Protocol Code

Governance can vote to effect change over the Euler Protocol for parameters such as:

1. **Default isolated** tier borrow **factor**
2. **Collateral** and **borrow factors** of specific assets
3. Inclusion of an asset in the **cross** and **collateral tiers**
4. Change in choice of **risk parameters** and general **methodology**&#x20;
