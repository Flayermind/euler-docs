# Gauges

## Introduction&#x20;

The Euler community help determine which markets receive an EUL distribution through the use of staking gauges. EUL token holders can visit the [Gauge](https://app.euler.finance/gaugeweight) page and stake their tokens against a particular market to indicate their preference for that market receiving an EUL distribution in future epochs. &#x20;
