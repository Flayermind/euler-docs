# EUL

Euler Protocol will be managed in the long term by a decentralised community of custodians. Custodians are holders of a protocol native governance token called Euler (EUL). Tokens can be used to propose upgrades to the protocol or vote on the proposals of others. EUL tokens represent voting shares. Custodians can vote on proposals directly or delegate their votes to a third party.
