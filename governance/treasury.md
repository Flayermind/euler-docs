# Treasury

The Euler Treasury will be governed by EUL token holders. The majority of the treasury will be distributed to borrowers on the protocol to hand governance powers to the protocol's core users. The remainder of the treasury will be set aside for future distributions through a grants programme.&#x20;

## Grants

To encourage developers to build on top of Euler and help integrate it into the wider DeFi ecosystem, a portion of the Euler Treasury will be allocated to an Euler Grants programme. The purpose of the grants is to foster the growth of Euler by establishing a culture of community-driven development, where individuals making improvements to the Euler protocol get a say in its future development.
