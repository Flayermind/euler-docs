# Treasury

The Euler Treasury will be governed by EUL token holders. A portion of the treasury will initially be locked in a vault and used to backstop the protocol in the event of a shortfall. The remainder of the treasury will be distributed to protocol users \(lenders and borrowers\), those insuring the protocol \(stakers\), as well as other contributors to the Euler ecosystem \(grant recipients\). The long-term goal is to hand over control of the protocol to stakeholders in its success.

## Staking

Coming soon.

## Grants

To encourage developers to build on top of Euler and help integrate it into the wider DeFi ecosystem, a portion of the Euler Treasury will be allocated to an Euler Grants programme. The purpose of the grants is to foster growth of Euler by establishing a culture of community-driven development.
