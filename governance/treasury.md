# Treasury

## Introduction&#x20;

All newly created EUL tokens enter circulation initially via the Euler Treasury. Today the Treasury comprises undistributed EUL tokens, assets accumulated as reserves from the Euler Protocol, and assets received in the course of other DAO operations. The treasury is managed by EUL token holders.

**Note**: the treasury wallet address will be shared here shortly.&#x20;

## Diversification

Before the DAO went live in June 2022 a portion of the treasury was diversified from EUL tokens into USDC tokens. In total 2,410,708 EUL tokens (8.869% of the total supply) were diversified into 32,647,000 USDC and USDT tokens.
