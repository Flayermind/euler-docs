# Treasury

## Introduction&#x20;

The Euler Treasury comprises undistributed EUL tokens, assets accumulated as reserves from the Euler Protocol, and assets received in the course of other DAO-DAO operations. The treasury is managed by EUL token holders.

**Note**: the treasury does not yet exist. This page will be updated when governance goes live. &#x20;
