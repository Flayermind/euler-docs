4. Select the asset you wish to sell.
5. Select the asset you wish to buy.

   * Select `Safe Max` to sell the amount such that your Euler sub-account will result in having a health score of 1.25.
   * Select `Liquidation` to sell the amount such that your Euler sub-account will end up at health score 1 (right on the edge of a liquidation).
   * Select `Max` to sell all the selected asset.
