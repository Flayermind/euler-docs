# Allowances

## About

Allowances enable users to add, update or revoke approval of the Euler protocol to access markets in the user's wallet. Users can change the amount of tokens in pre-approved markets.

## Step-by-step

1. Select an asset from the list.
2. Enter the amount you wish to allow the protocol to approve for use and click `Update`.
   * `Max` will allow the protocol to use the total supply of that token, not just what the user owns.
   * Enter `0` (zero) to restrict the protocol from using any more than zero tokens.
3. If listed, change the pre-approved amounts by entering a new amount and clicking `Update` or by selecting `Max`.
4. To completely revoke allowance, select the `Revoke` button.
