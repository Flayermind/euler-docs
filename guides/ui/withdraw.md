# Withdraw

## About

Users can withdraw assets from Euler at any time, directly to their wallet. Prior to withdraw, users should make sure debts are sufficiently repaid in order to withdraw their intended amount.&#x20;

## Step-by-step

1. Click on `Withdraw` in the `Quick Action` menu and select the Euler sub-account that you want to withdraw your tokens from and ensure that you have funds deposited.
2. Select the asset you are interested in.
3. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw:
   * Select `Max` to withdraw either your full balance or the most that the pool will allow if the pool has less available liquidity than you deposited.
   * Select `Safe Max` to withdraw enough such that your Euler sub-account will result in having a health score of 1.25.
   * Select `Liquidation` to withdraw enough such that your Euler sub-account will end up at health score 1 (right on the edge of a liquidation).
