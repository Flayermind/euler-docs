# Common Errors

### You have a collateral violation

Collateral violation means you're trying to borrow something without having enough collateral in your account to do so. Make sure you deposit a collateral asset first, like USDC. You can filter collateral assets on the markets page.

### No match, code: NETWORK\_ERROR

Please try refreshing the page and make sure you have a stable internet connection and your web3 wallet is on the correct RPC network (i.e. Ropsten Test Network).

### No match, code: UNPREDICTABLE\_GAS\_LIMIT

Try refreshing the page and trying the transaction again. This error also often occurs for other reasons. So if you keep having this issue, please check your browser’s console log and please report the error that it shows.

### Unknown error

Please try refreshing the page. If you receive the same error message, please check your browser’s log for errors and create a support ticket with what you find.

### Transfer amount exceeds balance, please check you have enough tokens in your wallet and make sure they are also not deposited into Euler

You don't have enough tokens in your wallet. If using the test, please make sure you have the correct testnet tokens from the official Euler testnet faucet.

### execution reverted: e/too-many-entered-markets

For a given account, you can enter 10 markets max. You should try the transaction with another account or sub-account.
