# Burn

## About

Burn enables users to 'repay' and undo their multiplied positions created by the Mint function by removing an equal amount of deposits and debts from an account.&#x20;

## Step-by-step

1. Ensure that you have sufficient supply & debt tokens in the sub-account you are burning on.
2. Select the Euler sub-account that you want to burn on.
3. Select the asset you are interested in.
4. Enter the amount you wish to burn:
   * Select `Max` to burn all available of selected asset.
   * While entering the amount, observe the Multiplier to make a decision.

## FAQ

**Can I use Burn to repay my debts?**\
****Burn is only used to close leverage positions from `Mint` and `Long` functions. Use the `Repay` function to close borrow positions.
