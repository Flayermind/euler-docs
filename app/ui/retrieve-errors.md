# Retrieve Browser Errors

## About

Sometimes an error will occur that needs further investigation by the Euler Labs team. If you have created a support ticket in [Discord](https://discord.gg/CdG97VSYGk), then you may be asked to report errors from the browser console to the team. You will find the instructions for doing this below.&#x20;

**IMPORTANT**: the Euler Labs team will never ask for your private keys or passphrase. &#x20;

## Step-by-step

1. Open the developer console by pressing Option + âŒ˜ + J (on macOS) or Shift + CTRL + J (on Windows/Linux). You can open it by right-clicking anywhere on the webpage and selecting Inspect Element option.
2.  On the top of the developer panel, there are multiple tabs like Elements, Console, Networks, and Sources.
