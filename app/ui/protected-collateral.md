# Protected Collateral

## About

Toggling collateral assets on Euler enables users to protect their tokens as collateral without permitting borrowing. Users may want to do this so that their collateral is purely being used as collateral for their own borrowed assets, while lowering other risks.&#x20;

## Step-by-step

1. At the desired sub-account page, find the asset under the supply column.
2. Click the `toggle` button in the `Entered` column in the Account view to enter/exit market.
   * Ensure that you have no outstanding borrows on the account that are collateralised by a given asset.

## FAQ

**The transaction builder won't let me toggle collateral, it presents a Collateral violation error.**\
****Toggling collateral will disallow using the asset as collateral, so you won't be able to borrow using the asset.
