# Gauges

## Introduction

The Euler community helps to determine which markets receive an EUL distribution through the use of staking gauges. EUL token holders can visit the [Gauge](https://app.euler.finance/gauges) page on the app UI and stake their tokens against a particular market to indicate their preference for that market receiving an EUL distribution in future epochs.

## Good to know

As it stands, users cannot vote on DAO proposals if they participate in gauge voting. Only users with EUL can direct further EUL emissions. You can remove your EUL at any point from the gauge to distribute further EUL emissions.&#x20;

For an emissions schedule of EUL, please see the [Epochs page.](distribution-1.md)
