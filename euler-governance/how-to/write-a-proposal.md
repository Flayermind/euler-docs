# Write a Proposal

### About

This guide describes how to get started with writing a governance proposal, firstly on the forum followed by a proposal on Snapshot (off-chain) or Tally (on-chain).

### Step-by-step

***

The Request for Comment (RFC) section on the forum is the first step in creating a governance proposal. Head over to the [RFC section](https://forum.euler.finance/c/rfc-request-for-comment/11) on the [Euler Governance Forum](https://forum.euler.finance) to create a new proposal. Make sure it’s well-formulated, be proactive with the community, engage with their comments, and be open to suggestions.

For consistency, the following proposal structure is advised:

### Proposal Structure <a href="#proposal-structure-5" id="proposal-structure-5"></a>

* **Title:** \[Enter Proposal Title]
* **Author(s):** \[enter name(s) of associated authors]
* **Related Discussions:** \[paste link here]
* **Submission Date:** \[Enter Date]

**Body Paragraphs/Sections:**

* **Simple Summary**: Give the community a TL;DR on your proposal; no more than 2-3 sentences.
* **Abstract**: Introduce and expand on the proposal. Highlight key points on how the proposal will improve stakeholder/token holder experience, protocol performance, and the overall implementation process.
* **Motivation**: What problems will this proposal address/solve? What’s the value-add?
* **Specification & Implementation**: Present the implementation of the proposal and answer key relevant question to the protocol
* **Voting**: Define what a “yes” and “no” vote entails. If there are any Snapshot votes or forum polls associated with this proposal, please attach them.

_A good governance proposal example can be found here:_ [eIP: Promote WBTC to collateral tier ](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-1-promote-wbtc-to-collateral-tier/27)



2\. Governance Proposal (on-chain or off-chain)

If the RFC is well-formulated and the community has a clear understanding of the proposal and supports your RFC, it will be moved by a mod to the governance category as an **eIP: Euler Improvement Proposal**. Please note that it usually takes a week (7 days) for a proposal to be moved from RFC to the eIP stage. Once an eIP has been assigned, the proposal can then be created on Snapshot or Tally using this eIP.

A Snapshot or Tally proposal does not always need to be posted by the original eIP author, it can be posted by someone else or one of the delegates in case the minimum threshold of EUL is not being met. The proposal on Snapshot or Tally should always have the link to the eIP attached. The parameters of the poll (Yes, No, different options for values) need to mirror the options discussed in the eIP.

Proposals that are rejected due to invalidity or insufficient support can be resubmitted. Approved proposals with sufficient support via governance/voting will be implemented by the Euler Foundation.
