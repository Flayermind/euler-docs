# Risk Factors List

_Note: the Collateral Factor of the lent asset(s) is multiplied by the Borrow Factor of the borrowed asset(s) to arrive at the final factor._

_For eg if you lend 1000 USD worth of USDC, you can borrow UNI in line with a final factor of 0.648 (0.90 x 0.72). Hence, 648 USD worth of UNI._

_Alternatively, if you lend 500 USD worth of USDC and 500 USD worth of WETH, your risk-adjusted collateral value is (500 x 0.90) + (500 x 0.88) = 890 USD. If you were to borrow UNI, you could borrow 890 x 0.72 = 640.8 USD worth of UNI._&#x20;

_Note that if you borrowed less UNI, for eg 500 USD worth, you could still borrow additional UNI or a cross tier asset like LINK against your risk adjusted collateral before hitting the threshold._\
