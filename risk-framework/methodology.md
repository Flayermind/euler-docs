1. Ranking all available ERC20 tokens according to risk parameters:
   1. Smart Contract Risk
   2. Centralisation
   3. Volatility
   4. Liquidity
2. Using that information to arrive at:
   1. Collateral Factor
   2. Borrow Factor
   3. Cross Tier Factor 
3. Simulate risk scenarios to maximise borrowing and lending activity and minimise bad debts
4. Update factors and methodology through governance
