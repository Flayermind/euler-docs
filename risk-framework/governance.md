# Governance

Governance ultimately votes on matters such as:  


1. Default isolated tier borrow factor
2. Collateral and borrow factors of specific assets
3. Inclusion of an asset in the cross and collateral tiers
4. Change in choice of risk parameters and general methodology 

While initially we will have significant influence over the risk framework, distribution of Euler tokens and growth of the community will enable us to decentralise this aspect.   


Ultimately, we will transition to a governance model where the community can participate in decision-making and be rewarded for good decisions whilst having skin in the game.
