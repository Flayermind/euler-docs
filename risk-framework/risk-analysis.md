# Introduction

Eulerâ€™s risk framework aims to do two things:

1. Maximise borrowing and lending activity 
2. Minimise the probability of bad debts

To achieve this, the Euler Team have created a methodology to stress test individual assets as well as simulate a portfolio of assets in tail risk scenarios.
