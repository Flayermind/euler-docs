# Methodology

## I**ntroduction**&#x20;

The Euler risk framework aims to do two things:

1. **Maximise** capital efficiency through borrowing and lending **activity**; and
2. **Minimise** risk and the probability of **bad debts.**

To achieve this, a methodology to stress test individual assets as well as simulate a portfolio of assets in tail risk scenarios.

## Methodology

**Ranking** all available ERC20 tokens according to risk parameters:

1. Smart Contract Risk
2. Centralisation
3. Volatility
4. Liquidity

Additionally, assessing **Oracle Risk**

In order to **arrive** at:

1. **Collateral** Factor
2. **Borrow** Factor
3. **Cross Tier** Factor&#x20;

**Simulate** risk scenarios to maximise borrowing and lending activity and minimise bad debts

**Update** factors and methodology through governance
